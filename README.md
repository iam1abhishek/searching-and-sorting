# Selection Sort:

Simple algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Inefficient for large data sets due to its quadratic time complexity, but it has the advantage of requiring only n swaps, where n is the number of elements.

# Bubble Sort:

Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, iterating through the list multiple times until no swaps are needed.
Also has a quadratic time complexity, making it inefficient for large data sets, but it is easy to understand and implement.

# Bubble Sort Optimization:

Includes optimizations like stopping the algorithm if no swaps are performed in a pass, which indicates the list is already sorted.
Can also be optimized by using a flag to track whether any swaps were made in a pass, reducing the number of iterations needed in certain cases.
